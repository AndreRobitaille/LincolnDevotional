              <em>The Believer’s Daily Treasure</em> is a Christian devotional
              first published in the 1850s, offering a Bible verse and short
              meditation for each day of the year. Abraham Lincoln owned a copy
              of this devotional—an early edition bearing his signature has
              survived—and evidence suggests he read from it during some of the
              most difficult and formative years of his life.
            </p>
            <p class="entry-text">
              This edition draws from one of the earliest printings issued by the
              Presbyterian Board of Publication. It restores the devotional
              without later editorial revisions that shifted the tone or content
              to match modern civic themes. Some possible misprints were kept to 
              keep it faithful to what Lincoln had, though scripture references 
              and text were corrected in a handful of places. The scripture text 
              comes from the 1769 Oxford King James Version, which would have 
              been in common use during Lincoln's time.
