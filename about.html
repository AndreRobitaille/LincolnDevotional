              <em>The Believer’s Daily Treasure</em> is a Christian devotional
              first published in the 1850s, offering a Bible verse and short
              meditation for each day of the year. President Abraham Lincoln 
              owned a copy of this devotional—an early edition bearing his 
              signature has survived—and evidence suggests he read from it 
              during some of the most difficult and formative years of his life.
            </p>
            <p class="entry-text">
              This edition draws from one of the earliest printings issued by the
              Presbyterian Board of Publication. It restores the devotional
              without later editorial revisions that shifted the tone or content
              to match modern civic themes.
            </p>
            <p class="entry-text">
              In many places, bible verses in the original devotional had 
              bits of prior versus, or removed the ends of verses, likely to fit 
              into the small book's format of two days on a page. In some cases 
              the verse reference was wrong, once even referring to the wrong 
              book of the bible. Since we aren't confined to a small book format, 
              I corrected these issues and used the complete text of the verses 
              from the 1769 Oxford King James Version, which would have been in 
              common use during Lincoln's time.
